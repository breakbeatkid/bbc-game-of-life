# Conway's Game of Life

This game was created for a coding aptitude test whilst applying for employment at the BBC. It is an rendition of the famous 'Game of Life' first proposed by the mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is implemented using Javascript in the node.js framework, using Chai and Mocha as a testing suite.

## Installing

To install and run, open a command line interface, navigate to the desired workspace and clone this repository there.

```console
    $ cd /path/to/workspace
    $ git clone git@github.com:breakbeatkid/bbc-game-of-life.git
```

To install the required dependencies for execution and testing, use the node package manager npm. Assuming node and npm are previously installed, this is achieved by entering the command:

```console
    $ npm install
```

## Testing

In order to ensure the desired functionality, thereby increasing maintainability, a testing framework is used. In this case Chai and Mocha. To execute the pre-written tests, enter the following command:

```console
    $ npm test
```
